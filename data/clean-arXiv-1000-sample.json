Researchers have proposed two pragmatic techniques to tackle this\nproblem. The first approach consists of reducing the queries to algebraic\nexpressions and proving their equivalence using an algebraic theory. The\nlimitations of this technique are threefold. It cannot prove the equivalence of\nqueries with significant differences in the attributes of their relational\noperators. It does not support certain widely-used SQL features. Its\nverification procedure is computationally intensive. The second approach\ntransforms this problem to a constraint satisfaction problem and leverages a\ngeneral-purpose solver to determine query equivalence. This technique consists\nof deriving the symbolic representation of the queries and proving their\nequivalence by determining the query containment relationship between the\nsymbolic expressions. While the latter approach addresses all the limitations\nof the former technique, it only proves the equivalence of queries under set\nsemantics. However, in practice, database applications use bag semantics. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel symbolic approach for proving query\nequivalence under bag semantics. We transform the problem of proving query\nequivalence under bag semantics to that of proving the existence of a\nbijective, identity map between tuples returned by the queries on all valid\ninputs. We implement this symbolic approach in SPES and demonstrate that SPES\nproves the equivalence of a larger set of query pairs (95\/232) under bag\nsemantics compared to the state-of-the-art tools based on algebraic (30\/232)\nand symbolic approaches (67\/232) under set and bag semantics, respectively.\nFurthermore, SPES is 3X faster than the symbolic tool that proves equivalence\nunder set semantics.\n","title_length":10,"abstract_length":267},{"id":2106.09582,"authors":"Cheng-Jui Yeh, Wei-Hsuan Yu","title":"Improvement of generalization of Larman-Rogers-Seidel's theorem","category":"math","abstract":"  A finite set $X$ in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is called an\n$s$-distance set if the set of distances between any two distinct points of $X$\nhas size $s$.

Some of\ntheir properties could be consequences of the particularity in the evolutionary\nmechanism, and some may be more universal, determined largely by external\nconditions. To understand the universality and particularity of the\nevolutionary process theoretically, evolutionary simulations (ES) alone are\ninsufficient, because the outcomes of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. Thus,\na reference system is required. The appropriate reference system for this\npurpose is a set of randomly sampled GRNs. In this study, we constructed a\nreference set using the method proposed by Nagata and Kikuchi (PLoS Comput Biol\n16 (2020) e1007969) and compared it with the results of ES. While this approach\ncan be applid to evolution in general, we focused on the emergence of\nbistability and enhancement of mutational robustness by evolution. We found the\nfollowing results: First, random sampling revealed that GRNs with high fitness\nexhibited bistability when we required a sensitive response to environmental\nchange. The increase in the fractions of bistable GRNs in ES occurred at higher\nfitness levels than those in the reference set.

The\nDDIS events, which can be identified with Pomeron exchange in the $t$-channel,\naccount for approximately $10\\%$ of all of the DIS events. Thus, when one\nmeasures DIS, one automatically includes the leading-twist Bjorken-scaling DDIS\nevents as a contribution to the DIS cross section, whether or not the\nfinal-state proton $p'$ is detected. In such events, the missing momentum\nfraction $x_{p'} \\sim 0.9$ carried by the final-state proton $p'$ in the DDIS\nevents could be misidentified with the light-front momentum fraction carried by\nsea quarks or gluons in the protons' Fock structure. As we shall show in this\narticle, the underlying QCD Pomeron-exchange amplitude which produces the DDIS\nevents does not obey the operator product expansion nor satisfy momentum sum\nrules. Thus we conclude that the quark and gluon distributions measured in DIS\nexperiments will be misidentified, unless the measurements explicitly exclude\nthe DDIS events and that a correct determination of the parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) derived from the DIS data requires the explicit subtraction of\nthe DDIS contribution from the full DIS cross section.\n","title_length":17,"abstract_length":222},{"id":2009.00115,"authors":"M.

However, over the past years, the quantity\nof polymer counterfeits has been increasing, so has the quality of\ncounterfeits. This shows that the initial advantage of bringing a new polymer\ntechnology to fight against counterfeiting is reducing. To maintain one step\nahead of counterfeiters, we propose a novel anti-counterfeiting technique\ncalled Polymer Substrate Fingerprinting (PSF). Our technique is built based on\nthe observation that the opacity coating, a critical step during the production\nof polymer notes, is a stochastic manufacturing process, leaving uneven\nthickness in the coating layer and the random dispersion of impurities from the\nink. The imperfections in the coating layer result in random translucent\npatterns when a polymer banknote is back-lit by a light source. We show these\npatterns can be reliably captured by a commodity negative-film scanner and\nprocessed into a compact fingerprint to uniquely identify each banknote. Using\nan extensive dataset of 6,200 sample images collected from 340 UK banknotes, we\nshow that our method can reliably authenticate banknotes, and is robust against\nrough daily handling of banknotes. Furthermore, we show the extracted\nfingerprints contain around 900 bits of entropy, which makes it extremely\nscalable to identify every polymer note circulated globally. As compared with\nprevious or existing anti-counterfeiting mechanisms for banknotes, our method\nhas a distinctive advantage: it ensures that even in the extreme case when\ncounterfeiters have procured the same printing equipment and ink as used by a\nlegitimate government, counterfeiting banknotes remains infeasible because of\nthe difficulty to replicate a stochastic manufacturing process.\n","title_length":9,"abstract_length":269},{"id":2006.09298,"authors":"Marco Zamparo","title":"Critical Fluctuations in Renewal Models of Statistical Mechanics","category":"math","abstract":"  We investigate the sharp asymptotic behavior at criticality of the large\nfluctuations of extensive observables in renewal models of statistical\nmechanics, such as the Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation, the\nFisher-Felderhof model of fluids, the Wako-Sait\\^o-Mu\\~noz-Eaton model of\nprotein folding, and the Tokar-Dreyss\\'e model of strained epitaxy.

We demonstrate that such a policy is\noptimal on the fluid and diffusion scales, while only involving a small\ncommunication overhead, which is crucial for large-scale deployments. In order\nto set the threshold optimally, it is important, however, to learn the load of\nthe system, which may be unknown. For that purpose, we design a control rule\nfor tuning the threshold in an online manner. We derive conditions which\nguarantee that this adaptive threshold settles at the optimal value, along with\nestimates for the time until this happens. In addition, we provide numerical\nexperiments which support the theoretical results and further indicate that our\npolicy copes effectively with time-varying demand patterns.\n","title_length":4,"abstract_length":161},{"id":2101.01939,"authors":"Merlin Christ","title":"Ginzburg algebras of triangulated surfaces and perverse schobers","category":"math","abstract":"  Ginzburg algebras associated to triangulated surfaces provide a means to\ncategorify the cluster algebras of these surfaces.

This service is mainly\nintended to reduce congestion and pollution in city centers but, as some\nauthors observe, in most crowd-shipping initiatives the crowd rely on private\nmotorized vehicles and hence the environmental benefits could be small, if not\nnegative. Conversely, a crowd-shipping service relying on public transport\nshould maximize the environmental benefits. Motivated by this observation, in\nthis study we assess the potentials of crowd-shipping based on metro commuters\nin the city of Brescia, Italy. Our contribution is twofold. First, we analyze\nthe results of a survey conducted among metro users to assess their willingness\nto act as crowd-shippers. The main result is that most young commuters and\nretirees are willing to be crowd-shippers even for a null reward. Second, we\nassess the potential economic impact of using metro-based crowd-shipping\ncoupled with a traditional home delivery service. To this end, we formulate a\nvariant of the VRP model where the customers closest to the metro stations may\nbe served either by a conventional vehicle or by a crowd-shipper. The model is\nimplemented using Python with Gurobi solver. A computational study based on the\nBrescia case is performed to get insights on the economic advantages that a\nmetro-based crowd delivery option may have for a retailing company.\n","title_length":10,"abstract_length":223},{"id":2109.07041,"authors":"Chen Chen, Yong Niu, Shiwen Mao, Xiaodan Zhang, Zhu Han, Bo Ai, Meilin\n  Gao, Huahua Xiao, Ning Wang","title":"Coalition Game based User Association for mmWave Mobile Relay Systems in\n  Rail Traffic Scenarios","category":"cs","abstract":"  Rail transportation, especially, high-speed rails (HSR), is an important\ninfrastructure for the development of national economy and the promotion of\npassenger experience.

Hence, rumors and fake news can quickly spread on a huge scale. This\nmay pose a threat to the credibility of social media and can cause serious\nconsequences in real life. Therefore, the task of rumor detection and\nverification has become extremely important. Assessing the veracity of a social\nmedia message (e.g., by fact checkers) involves analyzing the text of the\nmessage, its context and any multimedia attachment. This is a very\ntime-consuming task that can be much helped by machine learning. In the\nliterature, most message veracity verification methods only exploit textual\ncontents and metadata. Very few take both textual and visual contents, and more\nparticularly images, into account. In this paper, we second the hypothesis that\nexploiting all of the components of a social media post enhances the accuracy\nof veracity detection. To further the state of the art, we first propose using\na set of advanced image features that are inspired from the field of image\nquality assessment, which effectively contributes to rumor detection. These\nmetrics are good indicators for the detection of fake images, even for those\ngenerated by advanced techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs).\nThen, we introduce the Multimodal fusiON framework to assess message veracIty\nin social neTwORks (MONITOR), which exploits all message features (i.e., text,\nsocial context, and image features) by supervised machine learning. Such\nalgorithms provide interpretability and explainability in the decisions taken,\nwhich we believe is particularly important in the context of rumor\nverification. Experimental results show that MONITOR can detect rumors with an\naccuracy of 96% and 89% on the MediaEval benchmark and the FakeNewsNet dataset,\nrespectively.

The multiple\ngates of theG4FET are leveraged to create a discrete chaotic map with\nthreebifurcation parameters. The three tunable parameters are thegain of a\ntransimpedance amplifier (TIA), top-gate voltage ofn-channel G4FET, and\ntop-gate voltage ofp-channel G4FET. Twomethods are proposed for building\nchaotic oscillators using thisdiscrete map. The effect of altering bifurcation\nparameters onchaotic operation is illustrated using bifurcation diagrams\nandLyapunov exponent. A design methodology for building flexibleand\nreconfigurable logic gate is outlined and the consequentenhancement in\nfunctionality space caused by the existence ofthree independent bifurcation\nparameters is demonstrated andcompared with previous work.\n","title_length":12,"abstract_length":117},{"id":2107.04183,"authors":"Shi-min Liu, Jing Wang, Da-jun Zhang","title":"Solutions to integrable space-time shifted nonlocal equations","category":"nlin","abstract":"  In this paper we present a reduction technique based on bilinearization and\ndouble Wronskians (or double Casoratians) to obtain explicit multi-soliton\nsolutions for the integrable space-time shifted nonlocal equations introduced\nvery recently by Ablowitz and Musslimani in [Phys.

Most\nprior works on data-oblivious algorithms adopt the classical PRAM model to\ncapture parallelism. However, it is widely understood that PRAM does not best\ncapture realistic multicore processors, nor does it reflect parallel\nprogramming models adopted in practice.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of parallel data oblivious algorithms on\nrealistic multicores, best captured by the binary fork-join model of\ncomputation. We first show that data-oblivious sorting can be accomplished by a\nbinary fork-join algorithm with optimal total work and optimal\n(cache-oblivious) cache complexity, and in O(log n log log n) span (i.e.,\nparallel time) that matches the best-known insecure algorithm. Using our\nsorting algorithm as a core primitive, we show how to data-obliviously simulate\ngeneral PRAM algorithms in the binary fork-join model with non-trivial\nefficiency. We also present results for several applications including list\nranking, Euler tour, tree contraction, connected components, and minimum\nspanning forest. For a subset of these applications, our data-oblivious\nalgorithms asymptotically outperform the best known insecure algorithms. For\nother applications, we show data oblivious algorithms whose performance bounds\nmatch the best known insecure algorithms.\n  Complementing these asymptotically efficient results, we present a practical\nvariant of our sorting algorithm that is self-contained and potentially\nimplementable. It has optimal caching cost, and it is only a log log n factor\noff from optimal work and about a log n factor off in terms of span; moreover,\nit achieves small constant factors in its bounds.\n","title_length":5,"abstract_length":261},{"id":1801.09586,"authors":"Enrico Fatighenti and Giovanni Mongardi","title":"A note on a Griffiths-type ring for complete intersections in\n  Grassmannians","category":"math","abstract":"  We calculate a Griffiths-type ring for smooth complete intersection in\nGrassmannians.

The total training memory cost becomes the sum of (1) the memory cost\nof the gradient checkpoints and (2) the maximum memory cost of local forwards.\nTo achieve maximal memory cut-offs, one needs optimal algorithms to select GCs.\nExisting GCP approaches rely on either manual input of GCs or heuristics-based\nGC search on Linear Computation Graphs (LCGs), and cannot apply to Arbitrary\nComputation Graphs(ACGs). In this paper, we present theories and optimal\nalgorithms on GC selection that, for the first time, are applicable to ACGs and\nachieve the maximal memory cut-offs. Extensive experiments show that our\napproach not only outperforms existing approaches (only applicable on LCGs),\nand is applicable to a vast family of LCG and ACG networks, such as Alexnet,\nVGG, ResNet, Densenet, Inception Net and highly complicated DNNs by Network\nArchitecture Search. Our work enables GCP training on ACGs, and cuts off up-to\n80% of training memory with a moderate time overhead (~30%-50%).

The training and inference costs of these models, however,\nhave grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce\nthe costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared\nto previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the\nprimitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an\narchitecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original\nTransformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's\nimprovements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring\nReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and\nV projection in self-attention.\n  Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale\ngrows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We\nalso verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to\nsignificantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a\n500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4\nauto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X.\nFurthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to\nreach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter\nconfiguration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1\/3 of the training compute to\nachieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models\nand several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.\n","title_length":8,"abstract_length":242},{"id":2109.02738,"authors":"Shirley Anugrah Hayati, Dongyeop Kang, Lyle Ungar","title":"Does BERT Learn as Humans Perceive?

The Gauss-Bonnet term provides a nonlinear $k^4$\nterm to the GWs dispersion relation which has the same order as the standard\nlinear $k^2$ term at the time of horizon crossing around the Gauss-Bonnet\nattractor. The Gauss-Bonnet attractor regime thus provides a new scenario for\nthe primordial GWs which can be tested by observations.

Since\ninelastic parameters are very badly constrained by the current data, three\nschemes are considered: (a) scheme I with pure contact interactions and without\nthe $\\Lambda_c\\bar D^{(*)}$ interactions, (b) scheme II, where the one-pion\nexchange is added to scheme I, and (c) scheme III, where the $\\Lambda_c \\bar\nD^{(*)}$ are included in addition. It is shown that to obtain cutoff\nindependent results, OPE in the multichannel system is to be supplemented with\n$S$-$D$ mixing contact terms. We demonstrate that the experimental data for the\n$J\/\\psi p$ invariant mass distribution are consistent with the interpretation\nof the $P_c(4312)$ and $P_c(4440)\/P_c(4457)$ as $\\Sigma_c\\bar{D}$ and $\\Sigma_c\n\\bar{D}^{*}$ hadronic molecules, respectively, and that the data show clear\nevidence for a new narrow $P_c(4380)$, as a $\\Sigma_c^*\\bar D$ molecule, which\nshould exist as a consequence of HQSS. While two equally good solutions are\nfound in scheme I, only one of these solutions with the quantum numbers of the\n$P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ being $J^P=3\/2^-$ and $1\/2^-$, respectively,\nsurvives the requirement of regulator independence once the OPE is included.\nMoreover, we predict the line shapes in the elastic and inelastic channels and\ndemonstrate that those related to the $P_c(4440)$ and the $P_c(4457)$ in the\ncorresponding $\\Sigma_c^{(*)}\\bar{D}$ and $\\eta_cp$ mass distributions allow\none to confirm the quantum numbers given above, once the data are available.\n","title_length":7,"abstract_length":282},{"id":2008.07619,"authors":"Dan Sun, Martin F.

To explain how net current can be driven in spite of this\nconservation, the literature often appeals to mechanisms that transfer this\nnonresonant recoil momentum to ions, which carry negligible current. However,\nthis explanation does not allow the transport of net charge across magnetic\nfield lines, precluding ExB rotation drive. Here, we show that in steady state,\nthis picture of current drive is incomplete. Using a simple Fresnel model of\nthe plasma, we show that for lower hybrid waves, the electromagnetic energy\nflux (Poynting vector) and momentum flux (Maxwell stress tensor) associated\nwith the evanescent vacuum wave, become the Minkowski energy flux and momentum\nflux in the plasma, and are ultimately transferred to resonant particles. Thus,\nthe torque delivered to the resonant particles is ultimately supplied by the\nelectromagnetic torque from the antenna, allowing the nonresonant recoil\nresponse to vanish and rotation to be driven. We present a warm fluid model\nthat explains how this momentum conservation works out locally, via a Reynolds\nstress that does not appear in the 1D initial value problem. This model is the\nsimplest that can capture both the nonresonant recoil reaction in the\ninitial-value problem, and the absence of a nonresonant recoil in the\nsteady-state boundary value problem, thus forbidding rotation drive in the\nformer while allowing it in the latter.\n","title_length":7,"abstract_length":249},{"id":2101.04441,"authors":"Hang Thi Anh Nguyen, Michael Hoff, Truong Le Hoang","title":"On cylindrical smooth rational Fano fourfolds","category":"math","abstract":"  We construct new families of smooth Fano fourfolds with Picard rank $1$ which\ncontain open $\\Bbb A^1$-cylinders, that is, Zariski open subsets of the form $Z\n\\times \\Bbb A^1$, where $Z$ is a quasiprojective variety.

Our method involves spiraling a\nblue-detuned laser beam, which acts as a repulsive optical potential, around\nand towards the center of the BEC. This optical potential serves first as a\nrepulsive stirrer to initiate superflow within the BEC, and then as a pinning\npotential that transports the center of the superfluid circulation to the\ncenter of the condensate. By changing the rate at which the beam moves along\nthe spiral trajectory, we selectively control the net circulation introduced\ninto the BEC. We experimentally achieve pinned superflow with winding numbers\nas high as 11, which persists for at least 4 s.

For this\ntask, previous methods use recurrent neural networks for modeling temporal\nrelations in an input sequence. However, these methods overlook the fact that\nthe input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but\nbackground and irrelevant actions. This would induce recurrent units to\naccumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of\ninterest. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recurrent unit, named\nInformation Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the\ninformation relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to\naccumulate the input information.

To counter this threat, a versioning solid-state drive (SSD) that\nperforms versioning inside the SSD has been studied. An SSD is a suitable\ncandidate for data versioning because it can preserve previous versions without\nadditional copying, and provide high security with a very small trusted\ncomputing base (TCB). However, the versioning SSDs studied so far commonly use\na full disk versioning method that preserves all file versions in a batch. This\npaper demonstrates that SSDs, which provide full disk versioning, can be\nexposed to data tampering attacks when the retention time of data is less than\nthe malware's dwell time. To deal with this threat, we propose SGX-SSD, a\npolicy-based per-file versioning SSD to keep a deeper history for only the\nimportant files of users. However, since the SSD isn't aware of a file\nsemantic, and the versioning policy information should be securely received\nfrom the untrusted host computer, implementing the per-file versioning in SSD\nis a huge challenge. To solve this problem, SGX-SSD utilizes the Intel SGX and\nhas a secure host interface to securely receive policy information\n(configuration values) from the user. Also, to solve the file semantic\nunawareness problem of the SSD, a piggyback module is designed to give a file\nhint at the host layer, and an algorithm for selective versioning based on the\npolicy is implemented in the SSD. To prove our system, we prototyped SGX-SSD\nthe Jasmine OpenSSD platform in Linux environment.

In one dimension, it is known that segment\ntrees can be leveraged to facilitate any $n$ of these operations in\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$ time overall. Other than a few specific cases, until now, higher\ndimensional variants have been largely unexplored.\n  We show that no truly subquadratic time algorithm can support certain pairs\nof these updates simultaneously without falsifying several popular conjectures.\nOn the positive side, we show that truly subquadratic algorithms can be\nobtained for variants induced by other subsets. We provide two approaches to\ndesigning such algorithms that can be generalised to online and higher\ndimensional settings. First, we give almost-tight $\\tilde{O}(n^{3\/2})$ time\nalgorithms for single-update variants where the update operation distributes\nover the query operation. Second, for other variants, we provide a general\nframework for reducing to instances with a special geometry. Using this, we\nshow that $O(m^{3\/2-\\epsilon})$ time algorithms for counting paths and walks of\nlength 2 and 3 between vertex pairs in sparse graphs imply truly subquadratic\ndata structures for certain variants; to this end, we give an\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{(4\\omega-1)\/(2\\omega+1)}) = O(m^{1.478})$ time algorithm for\ncounting simple 3-paths between vertex pairs.\n","title_length":9,"abstract_length":294},{"id":2108.13663,"authors":"H.

To\nsupport a systematic investigation, we first present a taxonomy of distribution\nshifts by categorizing them into five conceptual groups: corruption shift,\nbackground shift, texture shift, destruction shift, and style shift. Then we\nperform extensive evaluations of ViT variants under different groups of\ndistribution shifts and compare their generalization ability with CNNs. Several\nimportant observations are obtained: 1) ViTs generalize better than CNNs under\nmultiple distribution shifts.

Both states are\ndescribed within the Abrikosov fermion representation of spins, and the effect\nof doping can be accessed by introducing charged holons. On doping CSL2,\ncondensation of charged holons leads to a topological d+id superconductor.\nHowever on doping CSL1 , in sharp contrast , two different scenarios can arise:\nfirst, if holons condense, a chiral metal with doubled unit cell and finite\nHall conductivity is obtained. However, in a second novel scenario, the\ninternal magnetic flux adjusts with doping and holons form a bosonic integer\nquantum Hall (BIQH) state. Remarkably, the latter phase is identical to a\n$d+id$ superconductor.

The\nfundamental reason is that photonic eigenstates can have arbitrary occupation\nnumbers, whereas in electronic systems these are limited by the Pauli\nprinciple. Here, we address the steady-state transport of pseudothermal photons\nbetween two waveguides connected through a cavity with Bose-Hubbard interaction\nbetween photons. One of the waveguides is subjected to a broadband incoherent\npumping. We predict a continuous transition between the regimes of Lorentzian\nand Gaussian chaotic light emitted by the cavity. The rich variety of\nnonequilibrium transport regimes is revealed by the zero-frequency noise. There\nare three limiting cases, in which the noise-current relation is characterized\nby a power-law, $S\\propto J^\\gamma$. The Lorentzian light corresponds to\nBreit-Wigner-like transmission and $\\gamma=2$.

While\nmore refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic\nassumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and\nlocal mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can\nreconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between\nnearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,\nresulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle\nthese challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing\ntessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning\nthe vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for\ncontextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube\nparameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible\nwith neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be\nemployed for the training.

Using the\nlifestyle-related information preceding their first purchases of specific\nprescription drugs, we could determine associations between online shoppers'\npast lifestyle choices and whether they suffered from a particular chronic\ndisease or not.\n  Results: Novel lifestyle risk factors were discovered in two exemplars --\ndepression and diabetes, most of which showed cognitive congruence with\nexisting healthcare knowledge. Further, such empirical findings could be\nadopted to locate online shoppers at high risk of these chronic diseases with\ndecent accuracy (i.e., [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve]\nAUC=0.68 for depression and AUC=0.70 for diabetes), closely matching the\nperformance of screening surveys benchmarked against medical diagnosis.\n  Conclusions: Mining online shopping behaviors can point medical experts to a\nseries of lifestyle issues associated with chronic diseases that are less\nexplored to date.

With payment channels\nand the network they construct, two users can move some transactions off-chain\nin a predetermined duration to avoid expensive and time-consuming on-chain\nsettlements. Existing work is devoted to designing high-throughput payment\nchannel networks (PCNs) or efficient PCN routing policies to reduce the fee. In\nthis paper, we investigate the PCN routing from a different perspective by\nanswering whether the routing fee of transactions can be saved by being a bit\nmore patient. The key idea is to reorder the processing sequence of atomic\ntransactions, other than to handle each of them separately and immediately. We\npresent two mechanisms, one is periodic transaction processing assisted by a\nPCN broker and the other is purely strategic waiting. In the former, all the\nincoming transactions in a short time interval are processed collectively. We\nformulate an optimization model to minimize their total routing fee and derive\nthe optimal permutation of processing transactions as well as the routing\npolicy for each of them. A Shapley value based scheme is presented to\nredistribute the benefit of reordering among the transactions efficiently and\nfairly. In the latter, we model the waiting time of a strategic transaction on\na single payment channel as the first passage time problem in queueing theory\nwhen the transaction value is higher than the edge capacity upon its arrival.\nBy capturing the capacity dynamics, we are able to calculate the recursive\nexpression of waiting for time distribution that is useful to gauge a user's\ncost of patience. Experimental results manifest that our cost redistribution\nmechanism can effectively save routing fees for all the transactions, and the\nwaiting time distribution coincides with the model well.\n","title_length":10,"abstract_length":296},{"id":2104.093,"authors":"Guillaume Lavigne and Christophe Caloz","title":"Magnetless Reflective Gyrotropic Spatial Isolator Metasurface","category":"physics","abstract":"  We present the concept of a magnetless Reflective Gyrotropic Spatial Isolator\n(RGSI) metasurface.

However, their\nperformance on Video Object Detection (VOD) has not been well explored. In this\npaper, we present TransVOD, an end-to-end video object detection model based on\na spatial-temporal Transformer architecture. The goal of this paper is to\nstreamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing the need for many\nhand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow, recurrent\nneural networks, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query\ndesign in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods\nsuch as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and\nclean. In particular, we present temporal Transformer to aggregate both the\nspatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame. Our temporal\nTransformer consists of three components: Temporal Deformable Transformer\nEncoder (TDTE) to encode the multiple frame spatial details, Temporal Query\nEncoder (TQE) to fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer\nDecoder to obtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the\nstrong baseline deformable DETR by a significant margin (3%-4% mAP) on the\nImageNet VID dataset. TransVOD yields comparable results performance on the\nbenchmark of ImageNet VID. We hope our TransVOD can provide a new perspective\nfor video object detection.

A set of vertices $S$ is\nmulticolored when $S$ has exactly one vertex from each color class.

By the calibrated model, the noise in\nreported accounting asset values hides about one-third of the true asset return\nvolatility and raises the banks' market equity value by 7.8\\% because the noise\nhides the banks' solvency risk from banking regulators. Particularly, those\nbanks with a high level of loan loss provisions, nonperforming assets, and real\nestate loans, and with a low volatility of reported total assets have noisy\naccounting asset values. Because of the substantial shock on the true asset\nvalues, the banks' assets were more opaque during the recent financial crisis.\nIn the second problem, we present an optimal portfolio selection model with\nvoluntary retirement option in an economic situation, where an investor is\nfacing borrowing and short sale constraints, as well as the cointegration\nbetween the stock and labor markets. Our model reinterprets the\nnon-participation puzzle in stock investment and early retirement in market\nbooms.

In this paper, we exploit\nsupervised auto-encoders to extract robust and discriminative speech\nrepresentations for Parkinson's disease classification. To reduce the influence\nof speaker variabilities unrelated to pathology, we propose to obtain speaker\nidentity-invariant representations by adversarial training of an auto-encoder\nand a speaker identification task. To obtain a discriminative representation,\nwe propose to jointly train an auto-encoder and a pathological speech\nclassifier. Experimental results on a Spanish database show that the proposed\nsupervised representation learning methods yield more robust and discriminative\nrepresentations for automatically classifying Parkinson's disease speech,\noutperforming the baseline unsupervised representation learning system.\n","title_length":8,"abstract_length":150},{"id":2001.00486,"authors":"Sri Aravinda Krishnan Thyagarajan, Adithya Bhat, Bernardo Magri,\n  Daniel Tschudi, Aniket Kate","title":"Reparo: Publicly Verifiable Layer to Repair Blockchains","category":"cs","abstract":"  Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several\ninstances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of\nillicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement\nagencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart\ncontracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable\nblockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents\nfrom both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the\nexisting proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and\ncannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n  We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable\nlayer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy\ncontracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates\nadditional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable\nsecurity guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains\nand start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may\npropose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that\ncomplies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable.\n  Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements,\ndoes not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be\nefficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate\nit by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS\nand PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum\nmainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs\nis almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity\nMultisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018% of the Ethers that\ncan be retrieved after the fix.\n","title_length":7,"abstract_length":286},{"id":2012.12513,"authors":"Zhao Li, Yefan Wang and Quan-feng Wu","title":"Categorization of two-loop Feynman diagrams in the $\\mathcal\n  O(\\alpha^2)$ correction to $e^+e^- \\rightarrow ZH$","category":"hep-ph","abstract":"  The $e^+e^- \\rightarrow ZH$ process is the dominant process for the Higgs\nboson production at the future Higgs factory.

Our\nwork is based on a recently proposed decomposition of the Neural Tangent Kernel\n(NTK) that has decoupled the dynamics of the training process into a\ndata-dependent component and an architecture-dependent kernel - the latter\nreferred to as Path Kernel. That work has shown how to design sparse neural\nnetworks for faster convergence, without any training data, using the\nSynflow-L2 algorithm. We first show that even though Synflow-L2 is optimal in\nterms of convergence, for a given network density, it results in sub-networks\nwith \"bottleneck\" (narrow) layers - leading to poor performance as compared to\nother data-agnostic methods that use the same number of parameters.

Using this method the\never rising data rate can be met with the increment of the number of antennas.\nThis comes at the price of energy consumption of higher amount, complex network\nsetups and maintenance. Moreover a high-velocity user experiences unpredictable\nfluctuations in the channel condition that deteriorates the downlink\nperformance. Therefore a proper number of antenna selection is of paramount\nimportance. This issue has been addressed using different categories of\nalgorithms but only for static users. In this study we proffer to implement\nantenna diversity in closed loop spatial multiplexing MIMO transmission scheme\nby operating more number of reception antennas than the number of transmission\nantennas for ameliorating the downlink performance of high-velocity users in\ncase of single user MIMO technology. In general our results can be interpreted\nfor large scale antenna systems like Massive MIMO even though a 4x4 MIMO system\nhas been executed to carry out this study here.

This paper focuses on\nthe phase portrait of a dynamical system that simulates the evolution of\naftershocks. The phase portrait allows us to understand why the Omori\nhyperbolic law is most clearly manifested after strong earthquakes.

In the\nexperience after the end of the Omori epoch, the deactivation coefficient\nchanges over time in a rather complex way, and can even becomes negative.

However, most existing methods\nstill suffer from one or more limitations, that include 1) the need for\ntraining the dense model from scratch with pruning-related parameters embedded\nin the architecture, 2) requiring model-specific hyperparameter settings, 3)\ninability to include budget-related constraint in the training process, and 4)\ninstability under scenarios of extreme pruning. In this paper, we present\nChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs continuous Heaviside\nfunction and a novel crispness loss to identify a highly sparse network out of\nan existing dense network. Our choice of continuous Heaviside function is\ninspired by the field of design optimization, where the material distribution\ntask is posed as a continuous optimization problem, but only discrete values (0\nor 1) are practically feasible and expected as final outcomes. Our approach's\nflexible design facilitates its use with different choices of budget\nconstraints while maintaining stability for very low target budgets.\nExperimental results show that ChipNet outperforms state-of-the-art structured\npruning methods by remarkable margins of up to 16.1% in terms of accuracy.\nFurther, we show that the masks obtained with ChipNet are transferable across\ndatasets.

We first prove that no such\nprotocol can guarantee bounded communication cost before the global\nstabilization time and propose a different approach that hopes for the best\n(synchrony) but prepares for the worst (asynchrony). Accordingly, we design an\noptimistic byzantine agreement protocol that first tries an efficient\ndeterministic algorithm that relies on synchrony for termination only, and\nthen, only if an agreement was not reached due to asynchrony, the protocol uses\na randomized asynchronous protocol for fallback that guarantees termination\nwith probability 1.\n  We formally prove that our protocol achieves optimal communication complexity\nunder all network conditions and failure scenarios. We first prove a lower\nbound of $\\Omega(ft+ t)$ for synchronous deterministic byzantine agreement\nprotocols, where $t$ is the failure threshold, and $f$ is the actual number of\nfailures. Then, we present a tight upper bound and use it for the synchronous\npart of the optimistic protocol.

The\nrecent realization of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with tunable\nChern numbers introduces the channel degree of freedom to the dissipation-free\nchiral edge transport and makes the study of the quantum phase transition\nbetween two topological states under zero magnetic field possible. Here, we\nsynthesized the magnetic topological insulator (TI)\/TI penta-layer\nheterostructures with different Cr doping concentrations in the middle magnetic\nTI layers using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). By performing transport\nmeasurements, we found a zero magnetic field quantum phase transition between\nthe C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states.

Our results show that the\nratio between the Hall resistance and the longitudinal resistance is greater\nthan 1 at the critical point, which indicates that the original chiral edge\nchannel from the C = 1 QAH state coexists with the dissipative bulk conduction\nchannels. Subsequently, these bulk conduction channels appear to self-organize\nand form the second chiral edge channel in completing the plateau phase\ntransition.

Current methods generally decide the early\nstopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be\nconsidered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter\nlayers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former\ncounterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the\nwhole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each\nother, thus degrading the final performance.

The simplest\ninstance of this construction, corresponding to the product of 3 repetition\ncodes, is a non CSS variant of the 3-dimensional toric code known as the Chamon\ncode. The general construction was introduced in Denise Maurice's PhD thesis,\nbut has remained poorly understood so far. The reason is that while hypergraph\nproduct codes can be analyzed with combinatorial tools, the XYZ product codes\nalso depend crucially on the algebraic properties of the parity-check matrices\nof the three classical codes, making their analysis much more involved.\n  Our main motivation for studying XYZ product codes is that the natural\nrepresentatives of logical operators are two-dimensional objects.

The sub-sample of clumps named \"mostly inside\" had\nthe highest surface mass densities followed by \"partly inside\" and \"outside\"\nsub-samples. These differences between the three sub-samples were shown to be\nstatistically significant using the KS test. The \"mostly inside\" sample also\nshowed the highest level of fragmentation compared to the other two. These\nprove that the clumps inside the G305 region are triggered. The G305 clump\npopulation is also statistically different from the Galactic average population\nrejecting redistribution as a likely consequence of feedback. The CDFs of clump\nmasses and their L\/M ratios are both flatter than the Galactic average,\nindicating that feedback in G305 has triggered star formation.

This motivates\nthe conjecture that field momentum might be due to the flow of a relativistic\nmass density (defined as energy density divided by the square of the speed of\nlight). This article investigates the velocity of such a mass flow and finds a\nconflict between two different definitions of it, both of which originally seem\nplausible if the flow is to be taken as real. This investigation is careful to\nrespect the transformation rules of special relativity throughout. The paper\ndemonstrates that the consensus definition of the flow velocity of\nelectromagnetic energy is inconsistent with the transformation rules of special\nrelativity, and hence is incorrect. A replacement flow velocity is derived\nwhich is completely consistent with those transformation rules. The conclusion\nis that these conflicting definitions of flow velocity cannot be resolved in a\nway that is consistent with special relativity and also allows electromagnetic\nfield momentum density to be the result of relativistic mass flow. Though real,\nfield momentum density cannot be explained as the flow of a relativistic mass\ndensity.

To address this problem, researchers have proposed\nmulti-model databases to support multiple data models in a uniform platform\nwith a single unified query language. However, since relational databases are\npredominant in the current market, it is expensive to replace them with others.\nBesides, due to the theories and technologies of RDBMSs having been enhanced\nover decades, it is hard to use few years to develop a multi-model database\nthat can be compared with existing RDBMSs in handling security, query\noptimization, transaction management, etc. In this paper, we reconsider\nemploying relational databases to store and query multi-model data.\nUnfortunately, the mismatch between the complexity of multi-model data\nstructure and the simplicity of flat relational tables makes this difficult.\nAgainst this challenge, we utilize the reinforcement learning (RL) method to\nlearn a relational schema by interacting with an RDBMS. Instead of using the\nclassic Q-learning algorithm, we propose a variant Q-learning algorithm, called\n\\textit{Double Q-tables}, to reduce the dimension of the original Q-table and\nimprove learning efficiency.

The\nkey ingredient of TAIL is a fine-grained estimator for expert state-action\ndistribution, which explicitly utilizes the transition function information.\nSecondly, considering practical settings where the transition functions are\nusually unknown but environment interaction is allowed, we accordingly develop\na model-based transition-aware AIL algorithm named MB-TAIL.

The\ninteraction complexity of MB-TAIL is $\\tilde{O} (H^3 |S|^2 |A| \/\n\\varepsilon^2)$, which improves the best known result of $\\tilde{O} (H^4 |S|^2\n|A| \/ \\varepsilon^2)$ in [Shani et al., 2021].

Recently, many works have suggested a possible increase\nin the fraction of major mergers in the early Universe, reviving the debate on\nwhich processes (e.g., cold accretion, star formation, mergers) most contribute\nto the mass build-up of galaxies through cosmic time. To estimate the\nimportance of major mergers in this context, we make use of the new data\ncollected by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times\n(ALPINE), which observed the [CII] 158 $\\mu$m emission line from a sample of 75\nmain-sequence star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < z < 5.9. We used, for the first\ntime, the morpho-kinematic information provided by the [CII] emission to obtain\nthe fraction of major mergers ($f_{MM}$) at z~5. By adopting different\nprescriptions for the merger timescales ($T_{MM}$), we converted this fraction\ninto the merger rate per galaxy ($R_{MM}$) and per volume ($\\Gamma_{MM}$). We\nthen combined our results with those at lower redshifts from the literature,\ncomputing the cosmic evolution of the merger fraction. This is described by a\nrapid increase from z~0 to higher redshifts, a peak at z~3, and a slow decrease\ntowards earlier epochs. Depending on the timescale prescription used, this\nfraction translates into a merger rate ranging between ~0.1 and ~4.0 Gyr$^{-1}$\nat z~5. Finally, we compare the specific star formation and star-formation rate\ndensity with the analogous quantities from major mergers. Our new ALPINE data\nreveal the presence of a significant merging activity in the early Universe.\nHowever, whether this population of mergers can provide a relevant contribution\nto the galaxy mass assembly at these redshifts and through the cosmic epochs is\nstrongly dependent on the assumption of the merger timescale.\n","title_length":16,"abstract_length":291},{"id":2101.11095,"authors":"Pablo del Moral, Slawomir Nowaczyk, Anita Sant'Anna, Sepideh Pashami","title":"Pitfalls of Assessing Extracted Hierarchies for Multi-Class\n  Classification","category":"cs","abstract":"  Using hierarchies of classes is one of the standard methods to solve\nmulti-class classification problems.

In\nthis work, we address this gap and leverage discrete attacks for online\naugmentation, where adversarial examples are generated at every step, adapting\nto the changing nature of the model. We also consider efficient attacks based\non random sampling, that unlike prior work are not based on expensive\nsearch-based procedures. As a second contribution, we provide a general\nformulation for multiple search-based attacks from past work, and propose a new\nattack based on best-first search.

For instance, in 2020, Ehrenreich et al. reported\ntransmission spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph yielding an anomalously\nlarge Doppler blueshift from the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b. Interpretations of\nthese observations invoke toy model depictions of gas-phase iron condensation\nin lower-temperature regions of the planet's atmosphere. In this work, we\nforward model the atmosphere of WASP-76b with double-gray general circulation\nmodels (GCMs) and ray-striking radiative transfer to diagnose the planet's\nhigh-resolution transmission spectrum. We confirm that a physical mechanism\ndriving strong east-west asymmetries across the terminator must exist to\nreproduce large Doppler blueshifts in WASP-76b's transmission spectrum. We\nidentify low atmospheric drag and a deep radiative-convective boundary as\nnecessary components of our GCM to produce this asymmetry (the latter is\nconsistent with existing Spitzer phase curves). However, we cannot reproduce\neither the magnitude or the time-dependence of the WASP-76b Doppler signature\nwith gas-phase iron condensation alone. Instead, we find that high-altitude,\noptically thick clouds composed of $\\rm Al_2O_3$, Fe, or $\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$\nprovide reasonable fits to the Ehrenreich et al. observations -- with marginal\ncontributions from condensation. This fit is further improved by allowing a\nsmall orbital eccentricity ($e \\approx 0.01$), consistent with prior WASP-76b\norbital constraints. We additionally validate our forward-modeled spectra by\nreproducing lines of nearly all species detected in WASP-76b by Tabernero et\nal. 2021.

This is distinct from the \"Li-rich giant\" problem and reflects\nbulk red clump star properties. We provide an analysis of the GALAH Li data\nthat accounts for the distribution of progenitor masses of field red clump\nstars observed today. Using standard models of the post-main sequence evolution\nof low-mass stars, we show that the observed distribution of Li among the bulk\nof field clump giants is natural, and that observations of clump and red giants\nin the field should not be compared without correcting for population effects.\nFor typical stellar population distributions, moderate Li abundances among the\nbulk of field clump giants are expected without the need for a new Li\nproduction mechanism. Our model predicts a large fraction of very low Li\nabundances from low mass progenitors, with higher Li abundances from higher\nmass ones. Moreover, there should be a large number of upper limits for red\nclump stars, and higher abundances should correspond to higher masses. The most\nrecent GALAH data indeed confirm the presence of large numbers of upper limits,\nand a much lower mean Li abundance in clump stars, which is concordant with our\ninterpretation.\n","title_length":12,"abstract_length":250},{"id":1904.02936,"authors":"Yibin Zhang","title":"Boundary clustered layers for an elliptic Neumann problem with large\n  exponent","category":"math","abstract":"  Given a smooth bounded domain $\\mathcal{D}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\\geq3$,\nwe study the existence and the profile of positive solutions for the following\nelliptic Nenumann problem\n  $$\\begin{cases}-\\Delta \\upsilon+\\upsilon=\\upsilon^p,\\,\\quad \\upsilon>0\n\\quad\\textrm{in}\\ \\mathcal{D},\\\\[1mm] \\frac{\\partial\n\\upsilon}{\\partial\\nu}=0\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\textrm{on}\\\n\\partial\\mathcal{D}, \\end{cases}$$ where $p>1$ is a large exponent and $\\nu$\ndenotes the outer unit normal vector to the boundary $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$.

The firefighters' goal is to eventually stop the spread\nof the fire. If there exists a strategy for $k$ firefighters to eventually stop\nthe spread of the fire, then we say $G$ is $k$-containable.\n  We consider the firefighter problem on the hexagonal grid, which is the graph\nwhose vertices and edges are exactly the vertices and edges of a regular\nhexagonal tiling of the plane.

Note that SACHER in UAV\nnavigation and control problems can be applied to arbitrary models of UAVs.\n","title_length":15,"abstract_length":207},{"id":2107.04077,"authors":"Rajmohan Muthaiah, Jivtesh Garg","title":"Thermal conductivity of Magnesium Telluride (MgTe) -- A first principles\n  study","category":"cond-mat","abstract":"  In this work, we report thermal conductivity(k) of magnesium telluride (MgTe)\nwith various crystallographic phases such as rocksalt, zincblende, wurtzite and\nnickel arsenic (NiAs) using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport\nequation.

Our first principles\ncalculations shows that ultra-low thermal conductivity of 2.645 Wm-1K-1 for\nNiAs phase is due to the dominant scattering of TA and LA phonons by low\nfrequency optical phonons. We also analyzed the length dependence thermal\nconductivity of MgTe at nanometer length-scales.

However, they suffer from drawbacks of\nnon-optimal accuracy and the requirement of a large amount of training data. A\nnew method named GroupRegNet is proposed to address both limitations. The\ndeformation fields to warp all images in the group into a common template is\nobtained through one-shot learning. The use of the implicit template reduces\nbias and accumulated error associated with the specified reference image. The\none-shot learning strategy is similar to the conventional iterative\noptimization method but the motion model and parameters are replaced with a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and the weights of the network.
